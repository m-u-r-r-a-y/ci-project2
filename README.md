# Space Game Project

Project Purpose:

The primary objective of this website is to utilize JavaScript to create an interactive learning experience tailored for preschool-aged children. The platform aims to introduce young users to basic computer and internet skills while fostering their curiosity about the universe.

# Initial Design 

Target Audience and Design Process:

This website is designed for children aged three and older, with the expectation that adult supervision will be provided. I utilized Figma to draft two pages, ensuring that the user journey remains short and focused. The inspiration for this project stemmed from a desire to help my child learn about the solar system and the Milky Way, while also enhancing their computer literacy skills.

As I have been spending more time on computer-related tasks due to my participation in the bootcamp, I wanted to create a shared activity that we could enjoy together. Informal education holds significant value in our household, and our growing competitiveness made the idea of incorporating a quiz particularly appealing.

# Final Design

## Landing page 

User Experience and Design Choices:

To ensure simplicity, the user journey begins with a landing page that introduces the concept and requires input from the user, which will be stored and displayed on the quiz page. The design and layout have been intentionally crafted to appeal to young users, while I opted for authentic images of the planets instead of whimsical illustrations. This choice aims to convey a sense of realism and preserve the mysterious quality of space, fostering a feeling of intrigue about the unknown. This atmosphere is further enhanced by the background music, which complements the overall experience.

## Quiz page

Design Consistency and Interactive Features:

To ensure consistency, the design of the quiz page closely mirrors that of the landing page. Questions are presented in a large, distinct font that stands out against the dark background, making it easy for both children and adults to read from a distance.

Recognizing that children are often drawn to visuals, the interactive button element has been replaced with a clickable image. For those who can phonetically sound out words, the names of the planets appear when the cursor hovers over the icons, aiding children in answering the questions. As with the landing page, sound effects have been incorporated to enhance the user experience.

In collaboration with Komal Karir, I developed a JavaScript function that allows for alternating sounds to play, providing feedback to users when their answers are correct or incorrect. I hope this feature adds an element of fun and amusement for the children!

Upon completing all attempts, the game prompts the user with their stored input from the landing page, followed by a message that reads either “Game over, try again” or “Well done, [Name]!!” This approach not only encourages keyboard usage to enhance overall computer literacy but also personalizes the experience to delight young users.

# Feedback

User Testing and Feedback:

During the testing phase, my child provided valuable feedback on the website, specifically requesting changes to the audio. In response, we recorded unique sound effects for correct and incorrect answers to enhance the interactive experience. Additionally, my child expressed a desire for more questions, which we happily incorporated into the quiz to improve engagement and educational value.

# Improvements

Future Improvements:

To enhance the user experience, I plan to replace the audio on the landing page with a more playful, game-themed soundtrack that appeals to young audiences. Additionally, the design of the scoring function on the quiz page could be made bolder and more prominent to draw attention to the user’s performance.

I also aim to include more personalized elements by allowing users to preset colors and pre-record audio clips, making the experience more engaging and unique while supporting their overall computer literacy development.

Furthermore, I will assess the website's performance, particularly with large media files. To improve load times, I will consider changing file formats to reduce size and preconnect certain resources to expedite content delivery.
